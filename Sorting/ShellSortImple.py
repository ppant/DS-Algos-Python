# Shell Sort Implementation

# Author: Pradeep K. Pant, ,  https://pradeeppant.com

# This is also called diminishing incremental sort
# The shell sort improves on insertion sort by breaking the original list into a 
# number of smaller sublists
# The unique way these sun lists are chosen is the key to the shell sort
# Instead of breaking the list into sublists of contiguous items, the shell sort uses an 
# increment ”i” to create a sublist by choosing all items that are ”i” items apart.
# Shell sort is efficient for medium size lists
# Complexity somewhere between O(n) and O(n2) square

def shell_sort(arr):
    sublistcount = len(arr)//2
    
    # While we still have sub lists
    while sublistcount > 0:
        for start in range(sublistcount):
            # Use a gap insertion
            gap_insertion_sort(arr,start,sublistcount)
        sublistcount = sublistcount // 2

def gap_insertion_sort(arr,start,gap):
    for i in range(start+gap,len(arr),gap):

        currentvalue = arr[i]
        position = i

        # Using the Gap
        while position>=gap and arr[position-gap]>currentvalue:
            arr[position]=arr[position-gap]
            position = position-gap
        
        # Set current value
        arr[position]=currentvalue

# Test 
arr = [45,67,23,45,21,24,7,2,6,4,90]
shell_sort(arr)
print (arr)
#[2, 4, 6, 7, 21, 23, 24, 45, 45, 67, 90]
